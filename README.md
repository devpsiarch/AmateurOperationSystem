# Amature level operating system
this is an operating system i will be working on as a pet project and learning more about low level software ,
## Dependencies 
You'll find all the scripts that will install all you need to run the OS , it is linux only so if your are using Windows you can try Windows Sub System for Linux.
## How to use ? 
- Run ```make OS``` to build everything
- note !!!! build.sh does not work anymore and am too lazy to fix it
